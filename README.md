The tasks are:

Critical Review on Cloud Migration for Global Aid
Python-Based Computational Mathematics and Statistics
Code Debugging and Programming Platforms
Stock Data Analysis for AAPL and MSFT
Reflections on Technical Issues
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, and yfinance.
You can install the libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy yfinance
GitHub Repository
A link to the GitHub repository with all the code and notebooks is provided below: GitHub Repository Link

Task 1: Critical Review on Cloud Migration
The critical review is available in the Task1_CloudMigration.pdf file.
It covers scalability, cost-effectiveness, security, disaster recovery, real-time data processing, global accessibility, and environmental impact of cloud computing vs. physical data centers.
Task 2: Python-Based Computational Mathematics
Functions Plotting: The Jupyter notebook for plotting the mathematical functions is located at Task2_FunctionsPlotting.ipynb.
It plots the specified functions with labels and titles.
Integer Checking and Random List Generation: This part includes a script to check for an integer larger than 300 and generate random integers. The notebook provides detailed comments explaining each step.
Task 3: Debugging Code
The code snippet debugging task can be found in the notebook Task3_Debugging.ipynb.
It identifies bugs, explains the fixes, and includes real-world examples of where the code could be used.
Task 4: Stock Data Analysis
Data Collection:

Historical data for Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) was downloaded using the Yahoo Finance API.
The data is analyzed using a scatter plot to compare the two stocks, along with a best-fit line for correlation analysis.
Results:

The analysis is available in Task4_StockAnalysis.ipynb.
Task 5: Reflections on Technical Issues
Reflections on challenges faced during the semester are provided in the Task5_Reflections.md file.
This includes issues related to setting up tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub and the steps taken to resolve these challenges.
Execution
To run the notebooks:

Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Jupyter Notebooks.
Run Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open each notebook and run the cells sequentially.
